Veklang (short: Vek) is a small hobbyist compiled language

# Roadmap

## Initial (TypeScript)

Why am I using TypeScript? Because I don't wanna spend much time here, I want to bootstrap ASAP.  
Also, this is not sequential. I can make any part at random times. Don't ask why.

- [x] General language syntax
- [ ] Lexer
- [ ] Parser
- [ ] Emitter
